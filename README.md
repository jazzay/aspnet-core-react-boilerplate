# Welcome to ASP.NET Core - React Boilerplate

This should get you up and running quickly with an Asp.Net Core backend and React frontend app.

This was based of the template located here: https://github.com/aspnet/NodeServices/tree/aspnetcore-rc2-migration
But simplied a bit to stick with pure React for frontend ui with Asp.Net Core used strictly for API/server for now.

Getting Started:

Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/jazzay/aspnet-core-react-boilerplate
```
From the console run 
```
tsd install
```
Followed by
```
npm install
```
Then for asp.net do:
```
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run
```
Navigate to http://localhost:5000

Enjoy!
